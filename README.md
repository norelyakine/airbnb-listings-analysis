## Steps & Methods

### Data Cleaning (R)
Key transformations performed:
- Extracted **rating** and **number of reviews** from the ‚ÄúReview and rating‚Äù column  
- Converted price strings (removed `$`, `,`) into numeric values  
- Extracted **start** and **end dates**, calculated **duration of stay**  
- Cleaned text in the ‚ÄúDetail‚Äù column  
- Extracted **property type**, **city**, and **country** from the ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù  
- Created a **Final_price** column (using offer price if available)  
- Added a **Discount** indicator
- The cleaned dataset is exported as: cleaned_data/clean_airbnb.csv

## Key Insights
- **Market Concentration**  
  Listings are heavily concentrated in North America, Western Europe, and Southeast Asia. Top cities like Kissimmee, Ubud, and Canc√∫n indicate strong demand in both urban and tourist hubs.
- **Property Type Trends**  
  Apartments, houses, and guesthouses dominate the supply. Niche types (treehouses, yurts...) offer unique positioning opportunities for experience-driven travelers.
- **Seasonal Pricing**  
  Prices peak in January and December, with a mid-year dip; revealing clear seasonality. This supports dynamic pricing strategies and promotional planning.
- **Customer Satisfaction**  
  Ratings are consistently high (mostly 4.7‚Äì5.0), suggesting strong service quality or positive user bias. Low ratings are rare, reinforcing platform reliability.
- **Price vs Rating**  
  No strong correlation between price and rating, budget listings perform as well as premium ones. Value perception is driven more by experience than cost.
